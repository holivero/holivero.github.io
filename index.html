    <h1>Héctor Olivero Q.</h1>
    <p>Currently, I am an Associate Professor at the Mathematical Engineering Institute at Faculty of Engineering at Universidad de Valparaíso (UV) 
        and a member of the research center CIMFAV-UV. Previously, from September of 2017 to July of 2018, I held a Postdoctoral position at INRIA 
        Sophia Antipolis - Méditerranée where my host was Denis Talay. From March 2018 to March 2021 I developed a FONDECYT Postdoctoral 
        Research project with the sponsoring  of Gregorio Moreno.  
        
        In 2016 I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematical Modeling at Universidad de Chile under the supervision of Joaquin Fontbona. During my Ph.D. thesis 
        I also worked with Mireille Bossy.  Before that, in 2011 I completed my Mathematical Engineering degree at Universidad de Chile under the supervision of Joaquin Fontbona.
